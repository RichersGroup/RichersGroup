Our research is currently focused on investigating the role of neutrino transport in the central engines that drive core-collapse supernova explosions and gamma-ray bursts. Most of our work is done using and extending publicly available open-source code.

We develop tools that will allow us to model the interactions of neutrinos with matter in exploding stars and merging neutron stars. This is an incredibly challenging computational problem that I am moving forward by combining Monte Carlo and deterministic transport algorithms, particle-in-cell plasma methods, and many-body quantum mechanics approaches that will enable us to more precisely understand and predict what happens in cosmic explosions.
